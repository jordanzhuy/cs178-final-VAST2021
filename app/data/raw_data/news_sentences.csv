564|World Source|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||3|"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore," he told the Times.
564|World Source|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||4|Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within.
564|World Source|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||5|Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market.
564|World Source|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||6|Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited.
564|World Source|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||7|Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources.
564|World Source|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||8|GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore.
564|World Source|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||9|Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells.
564|World Source|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||10|But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done.
564|World Source|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||11|Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term."GAStech

564|World Source|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||13|It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry.

728|World Source|Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry||1982-10-02||0|The world of gas is distant, difficult and far flung.
728|World Source|Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry||1982-10-02||1|In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area.
728|World Source|Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry||1982-10-02||2|One of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation.
728|World Source|Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry||1982-10-02||3|But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it.
728|World Source|Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry||1982-10-02||4|But as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy.
728|World Source|Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry||1982-10-02||5|Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise.
728|World Source|Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry||1982-10-02||6|It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies.

728|World Source|Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry||1982-10-02||12|The easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974.So thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do.
728|World Source|Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry||1982-10-02||13|The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.

751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||4|"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore," he told the Times.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||5|Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||6|Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||7|But projects in Europe have been slow to take off, beset with opposition from government and local communities.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||8|Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||9|Many environmentalists believe that hyper-acidic substrate removal can damage marine environments, and oppose the extraction of new fossil fuel resources.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||10|But drilling offshore avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local councils, communities and landholders.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||11|Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||12|There is also the possibility of finding oil.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||13|GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||14|"We're
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||15|very comfortable that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous," SanJorge said.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||16|"Is any of that exploitable?
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||17|That's the billion dollar question, and GAStech is wiling to invest in the answer.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||18|"Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||19|But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||20|Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term."GAStech
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||21|is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||22|It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry.
751|International Times|Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea||1984-05-03||23|The task in the next 10 years is to try these things out, see if they work."
